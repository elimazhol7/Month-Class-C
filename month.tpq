1. Yes. I included a private method to convert names/abbreviations into numbers. 
This supports the translation between representations but does not need to be exposed to the user. 

2. This is possible with function overloading. In C++, methods with the same name can exist as long as their parameter lists differ. 
The compiler chooses the right one based on the arguments passed.

3. The advance method always returns a Month object. 
Once the caller has the object, they can choose how to display it (number, short name, or full name).

4. No, it does not prompt. The driver program should handle prompts so the class remains flexible and can be reused in different situations.

5. No. It only prints the requested month form (number, short name, or full name). Adding extra formatting like newlines would reduce flexibility.

6. I created separate output methods (output_full, output_short, output_number) so the programmer can choose explicitly. 

7. It checks the first character. If itâ€™s a digit, it treats the input as a number.
 Otherwise, it assumes a word and checks whether it matches a full name or a 3-letter abbreviation.

8. It allows multiple tests in one run, which is more convenient for both the programmer and user.

9.Some tests are hard-coded for consistency, but the user can also enter their own month input.

10. The built-in tests are ordered, but user input is free choice. A mix of both is most useful since it guarantees coverage while also letting the programmer test freely.
